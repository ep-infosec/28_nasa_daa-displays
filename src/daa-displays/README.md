DAA-Displays Widgets Library
-------

This repository includes a prototype implementation of daa-displays,
a JavaScript library for rendering interactive cockpit display systems.
The visual appearance of the widgets closely resembles that of common 
display elements used in real cockpit display systems, including:
Compass(1); Interactive Map(2); Airspeed tape(3); Virtual horizon(4); 
Altitude tape(5); and Vertical speed tape(6). 
The functional logic driving the behavior of the widgets is entirely 
specified by an external component, e.g., an executable formal
specification or a software implementation.
Simulations tools supporting comparative analysis of cockpit displays
are also provided with the library.

### Documentation
API documentation is in folder [`docs`](docs). 
Example cockpit displays developed using the daa-display library are
in folder [`examples`](examples) provided that illustrate the main 
functionalities of the library.

### Current Release
daa-displays-v2018.12.01 (December 2018)
